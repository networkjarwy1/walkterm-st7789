# How it works?
### I have changed it a lot. I am currently working on version with ST7789 display. It can display text, pixels, etc. but I will make it work with cardkb and RF module so user could execute commands in its terminal and communicate with other walkterms using RF module, It can communicate using wifi, but RF can communicate on longer ranges

# How to download this repository?
### you need to clone it with submodules or it will not work
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/networkjarwy1/walkterm.git
```
### if you have already clonned it without submodules
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
